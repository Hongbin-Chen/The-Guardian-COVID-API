This cookiecutter creates a boilerplate for a Python project.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ final_project_chenhongbin
```

## Features

While there has been a api package for the Guardian, our package will focus on the news on the Guardian releated to the covid. None of the code is copied/paraphrased from the existed package. 

If there is any similarity, it would be just a coincidence. 

First discovered in January 2020, we have suffered from COVID-19 for almost a whole year. It is of great urgency to continuously update our knowledge about the virus.

It is kind of a bummer that the API only return 9 results at a time for public user. However, we are going to design our function in a base of generalizaiton. If wanting to get more result, contact the Guardian Office.
